				<span>Night Furies</span> are very strong for dragons of their size. They are capable of carrying two or
				more
				Vikings, as well as flying with heavy luggage. So, in the series, Toothless held Stoick with several
				other small Vikings. If necessary, the <span>Night Fury</span> can even lift the Dire Beast, despite the
				fact that
				this dragon weighs over 1000 kilograms. <span>Night Furies</span> have strong jaws that can easily tear
				out tall
				bushes. <span>The Night</span> Fury is one of the fastest dragons known. The streamlined, smooth body
				shape, massive
				powerful wings and medium size help to develop high speed. This is also facilitated by short and thin,
				sail-like plates on the back, which prevent strong air resistance. <span>The Night Fury</span> is said
				to be able to
				break the sound barrier, however, this only occurs in the series' opening sequence.
